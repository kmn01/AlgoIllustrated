The menu is composed of the following features:\
<br><b>Add Node</b> To add a new node to the existing graph. When selected, a new node appears somewhere on the canvas. \
<br><b>Delete Node</b> To delete a node from the existing graph. When selected, the node next clicked on by you is deleted from the graph. \
<br><b>Add Edge</b> To add an edge across any two nodes in the graph. After selection, you will have to click on the two nodes you wish to connect to add an edge between them.\
<br><b>Delete Edge</b> To delete an edge from the graph. After selection, you will have to click on the edge you wish to delete from the graph.\
<br><b>Simulate BFS</b> To simulate the Breadth First Search algorithm on the graph. When selected, you will be provided with buttons to go to the next or previous step as valid under the BFS algorithm.\
<br><b>Simulate DFS</b> To simulate the Depth First Search algorithm on the graph. When selected, you will be provided with buttons to go to the next or previous step as valid under the DFS algorithm.\
<br><b>Clear</b> To reset the existing graph and start from scratch. When selected, the screen is rid of all its contents.\

The pseudocode panel is enabled whenever an algorithm is selected from the menu, and displays the corresponding pseudocode for your better understanding.\
